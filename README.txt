detailed Purkinje neuron model and a simpler surrogate model that runs
>400 times faster. BMC Neuroscience

There are 2 seperate NEURON models here:

1) A Two compartment Purkinje cell model (reduced model, fast run
time)
2) A 1089 compartment Purkinje cell model (detailed model with
realistic morphology, slow run time)

To run the Two compartment model: Click on "mosinit_simple.hoc"
To run the 1089 compartment model: Click on "mosinit_full.hoc"

Both these models share and use the same .mod mechanisms. 

As an adside the NEURON code used to generate the reduced, Two
compartment model from the 1089 compartment model is included in the
folder called "collapse_algorithm"
